## ðŸ¤– Agentic AI Processing Pipeline

### Core Agent Workflow
```
Supervisor â†’ Email-Fetcher â†’ Pre-Processor â†’ Entity-Extractor (LLM) 
â†’ Schema Validator â†’ Classifier â†’ Validator/De-dupe â†’ State-Updater â†’ Notifier
```

### Agent Responsibilities
1. **Supervisor**: Orchestrate runs, attach run-ids, collect metrics
2. **Email-Fetcher**: Pull finance emails via OAuth with smart filtering
3. **Pre-Processor**: Convert MIME/HTML/PDF to clean plaintext
4. **Entity-Extractor**: LLM-powered extraction of amounts, dates, merchants
5. **Schema Validator**: Reject malformed data, validate currencies/dates
6. **Classifier**: Categorize into Subscriptions/Bills/Loans
7. **Validator/De-dupe**: Remove duplicates and out-of-range data
8. **State-Updater**: Persist clean entities to database
9. **Notifier**: Queue reminders and sync dashboard updates

### Scale Handling Strategy
- **Batch Processing**: Process 100 emails at a time with pagination
- **Async Jobs**: Use job queues for fan-out processing
- **Caching**: Hash message IDs to avoid reprocessing
- **Rate Limiting**: Throttle LLM calls with batch optimization
